This is The Jogo Perl Game Framework.

Jogo is the portuguese word for "game", and this framework aims
to provide a componentized platform for game development in Perl.

The basic view of the framework is:

 * Multi-thread support in a transparent way
 * Model-View-Controller architecture
 * Reuseable components
 * Componentized game logic

You should be able to find some example games in the repository as well.
